# file: setup_drive_mbr.sh
# This file is a script for creating a virtual image of a block
# device for sharing files through the g_mass_storage drive of
# the raspbians. The following environment variables can be used
# for customizing the file:
#
# TARGET_DEVICE: path of the device to be created including name,
#                its default value is `/piusb.bin`
# BLOCK_SIZE: block size of the virtual drive.
#             Its default value is set to 512, the fat's default value
# DEVICE_SIZE: The size of the device to be created. This has to have the
#              format of the `dd`` argument `seek``.
#              Its default value is 1024*1024*2 for a total of
#              BLOCK_SIZE x DECIVE_SIZE = 1G
#
# - Usage example:
#
# Create a /piusb.bin file of 1GiB
#
# # ./setup_drive_mbr.sh
#
# Create a local.bin file of 512MiB
#
# # TARGET_DEVICE=./local.bin BLOCK_SIZE=512 DEVICE_SIZE=$[1024*1024] ./setup_drive_mbr.sh
#
# The created file will have a partition table of 1 Master Record and
# 1 volume record of the full size of the disk with a exFAT partition.

# name of the file system storage image, if the script was
# invoked with a first argument, such will be the target device
# otherwise its set to a default name/path
